After finishing learning C during a Piscine / Bootcamp creating a library of useful functions is a logical step to confirming your knowledge and creating something you can use and add upon.

That is why this is the 42, Epitech and WeThinkCode staring project among other origin stories.

I created this library at 42 School USA, and the files are currently still named `ft_*.c`

## How to get started:
Recode some of the C langauge standard library along with other useful functions.

Use my file names as examples.

Read the man pages for function in the standard libraries and recreate them.
